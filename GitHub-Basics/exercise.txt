Explain what the terminal is in your own words:

It is a window into which you can type commands 
that are then executed by your computer's operating system. And also using git commands
you can push projects from vs code to your GitHub profile.

What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?:

That GIT is installed on your personal computer "located in the terminal 
simply by trying to run git from the terminal the very first time.
$ git --version
If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.
" and GitHub is hosted in the cloud.

What are the steps to fork a GitHub repository?:

-Log in to your GitHub account.
-Navigate to the repository you want to fork.
-Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository's page.
-Select where you want to fork the repository (e.g., your own GitHub account or an organization you belong to).
-Wait for the forking process to complete. Once the forking process is done, you'll have your copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
-You can now clone this forked repository to your local machine and start working on it.
